In this project my goal is to build the necessary python scripts in order to put a working solution in production from the [Rossmann Store Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales) competition. Not every participant share their code, but thanks to [**Johan Manders**](https://www.kaggle.com/johanmanders) who got the 72th place I have something to work with. With his published solution one could get the 13th place as he explains [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/discussion/17979).

His solution for this competition can be found [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/JohanManders/ROSSMANN-KAGGLE/blob/master/ROSSMANN%20STORE%20SALES%20COMPETITION%20KAGGLE.ipynb).   

The data needs to be [downloaded](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data) and stored in the `datesets` folder.

The code is not ready yet, so far I got most of the data preprocessing stages done.
